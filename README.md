#  House Price Prediction Project  

This project predicts **house prices** based on various features using **Machine Learning models**. It involves **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building** to achieve accurate predictions.  

---

##  Project Overview

- **Goal**: Build a robust ML model to predict house prices for better decision-making.  
- **Dataset**: Real estate dataset (collected & processed for Indian market data).  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Location, size, number of rooms  
  - Property type and amenities  
  - Price variations based on market trends  

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Languages & Libraries**:  
  `Python` • `Pandas` • `NumPy` • `Matplotlib` • `Seaborn` • `Scikit-learn`  

- **Techniques**:  
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
  - Feature Engineering  
  - EDA & Visualization  
  - Regression Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

##  Analysis Highlights

1️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
- Handled missing values and outliers  
- Feature encoding and scaling  

2️⃣ **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
- Distribution of prices across different regions  
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps  
- Visualized trends by size, location, and amenities  

3️⃣ **Model Building & Evaluation**  
- Trained multiple regression models  
- Compared metrics: **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **R²**  
- Selected the best-performing model for deployment
